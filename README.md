# Aahar - Food Donation App Version 1.0.0

Aahar is a food donation app built on Java and powered by Firebase. Its primary objective is to facilitate the process of food donation, connecting food donators with receivers in a seamless manner. With Aahar, you can contribute to reducing food waste and helping those in need by donating surplus food items.

## Registration

To get started with Aahar, you need to register by providing the following information:

- Email: Your email address will be used for account verification and communication purposes.
- Password: Choose a secure password to protect your account.
- Name: Your name will be displayed to other users when you make a food donation.
- Phone Number: A contact number is required for communication between donators and receivers.

## Email Verification

## Donating Food

#### Donate Activity

In the "Donate" section of the app, you can easily pin your location on the map to indicate the availability of food donations. The following information is required when creating a food pin:

- Food Item Name: Specify the name of the food item you wish to donate.
- Food Item Description: Provide a brief description or additional details about the donated food.
- Phone Number Visibility: Choose whether or not you want to display your phone number to receivers.

Note: Aahar does not have an in-app messaging feature. If you choose to display your phone number, it will only be visible to receivers.

#### Food Map Activity

In the "Food Map" activity, User can view all available food pins. They can explore the map and click on a food pin to see details about the donation. However, the phone number of the donator will not be displayed in this activity. It is only visible in the "Receiver" activity.

## Receiving Food

In the "Receiver" activity, users can find food pins near their location. By clicking on a specific food pin, they can access detailed information about the donation. Moreover, receivers have the option to navigate to the donator's residence using the Google Maps. This feature helps receivers easily collect the donated food.

Once the receiver has collected the food, the donator can remove their pin from the food map.

## History Activity

The "History" activity in Aahar keeps track of all your past food donations. It displays a list of your previous donations, including the food item name and description. You have the ability to delete individual donation records unless you delete your profile entirely.

## Additional Features

Aahar provides the following additional features to enhance your experience:

- Reset Password: In case you forget your password, you can reset it by following the password recovery process.
- Change Email: If you wish to update your email address, you can do so through the app's settings.
- Update Name and Phone Number: You have the flexibility to modify your name and phone number as needed.
